# check-test-coverage.sh — Stub. Delegates to the Quality Engineer's implementation.
#
# The authoritative coverage parser lives at:
#   agents/quality-engineer/scripts/validate-test-coverage.py
#
# It already handles lcov (.info) and Cobertura XML, supports --min threshold
# and --auto file discovery. Use that script directly instead of this one.
#
# Example:
#   python agents/quality-engineer/scripts/validate-test-coverage.py --min 80 --auto
